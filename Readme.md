This project is an anagram solver serving as an introduction to Python.
There are two sections of this program:
1 - The user inputs the anagram and it is returned solved.
2 - The user inputs a plaintext word and an anagram of the word is returned

The execution speed depends on the placement of the word in the dictionary file, e.g words beginning with "A" will be solved quicker than words beginning with "Z"
